Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking\r\nI/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.</p>\n<p>It’s an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, which is designed to build scalable network applications. It can\r\nhandle many concurrent connections at a time, where when connection request are made concurrently for each connection a\r\ncallback is fired. If there is no task to be performed Node will go to sleep.</p>\n<p>Node.js connection handling mechanism is super efficient compared to our existing classical thread based model. Thread-based\r\nnetworking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore, users of Node.ja are free from worries of\r\ndead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node directly performs I/O, so the process\r\nnever blocks. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.js</p>\n<h1>Architecture</h1>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/9d5d5eccfeadaa37a15d7e19286daaaf/b4294/nodejs-architecture.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 39.285714285714285%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"node.js architecture\"\n        title=\"Architecture\"\n        src=\"/static/9d5d5eccfeadaa37a15d7e19286daaaf/b4294/nodejs-architecture.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9d5d5eccfeadaa37a15d7e19286daaaf/2bad8/nodejs-architecture.jpg 224w,\n/static/9d5d5eccfeadaa37a15d7e19286daaaf/fb05c/nodejs-architecture.jpg 448w,\n/static/9d5d5eccfeadaa37a15d7e19286daaaf/b4294/nodejs-architecture.jpg 600w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Node.js follows Single Threaded with Event Loop Model.

It essentially means a Node.js based server never\r\nwaits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events\r\nof Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Super Fast\r\nBeing built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js is super efficient and quick in code execution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Single Threaded but Highly Scalable\r\nNode.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking\r\nway and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers like Apache which create limited threads to\r\nhandle requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No Buffering\r\nNode.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>When to use Node.js?</h1>\n<p>Node.js as a platform fits and is typically used when the requirements include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I/O bound Applications</li>\n<li>Data Streaming Applications</li>\n<li>Data Intensive Real-time Applications (DIRT)</li>\n<li>JSON APIs based Applications</li>\n<li>Single Page Applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Worth noting is that Node.js also represent a \"JavaScript\" everywhere paradigm, and there is a lot of software\r\ndevelopers that are familiar with JavaScript.</p>\n<h1>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia - Node.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NPM</a></li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/articles/nodejs-architecture-overview/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["4011214723"]}
