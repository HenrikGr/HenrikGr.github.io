Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking\nI/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.</p>\n<p>It’s an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, which is designed to build scalable network applications. It can\nhandle many concurrent connections at a time, where when connection request are made concurrently for each connection a\ncallback is fired. If there is no task to be performed Node will go to sleep.</p>\n<p>Node.js connection handling mechanism is super efficient compared to our existing classical thread based model. Thread-based\nnetworking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore, users of Node.ja are free from worries of\ndead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node directly performs I/O, so the process\nnever blocks. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.js</p>\n<h1>Architecture</h1>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 600px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/9d5d5eccfeadaa37a15d7e19286daaaf/82472/nodejs-architecture.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 39.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"node.js architecture\"\n        title=\"Architecture\"\n        src=\"/static/9d5d5eccfeadaa37a15d7e19286daaaf/82472/nodejs-architecture.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9d5d5eccfeadaa37a15d7e19286daaaf/28e0f/nodejs-architecture.jpg 224w,\n/static/9d5d5eccfeadaa37a15d7e19286daaaf/ebdf6/nodejs-architecture.jpg 448w,\n/static/9d5d5eccfeadaa37a15d7e19286daaaf/82472/nodejs-architecture.jpg 600w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Node.js follows Single Threaded with Event Loop Model. Node.js Processing model mainly based on JavaScript event based\nmodel with JavaScript callback mechanism.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>V8 Engine</em></strong>\nIt’s an open source JIT(Just In Time) compiler written in C++ which has outperformed PHP, Ruby and Python performance wise. </li>\n<li><strong><em>Libuv</em></strong>\nThis C++ library that handles Node’s asynchronous I/O operation and main event loop. There are thread pool reserve in\nLibuv which handles the thread allocation to individual I/O operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Other Low-Level Components</strong>\nc-ares, http parser, OpenSSL, zlib, and etc, mostly written in C/C++.</li>\n<li><strong>Application</strong>\nHere is your code, modules, and Node.js' built in modules, written in JavaScript (or compiled to JS through\nTypeScript, CoffeeScript, etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Binding</strong>\nBinding basically is a wrapper around a library written in one language and expose the library to codes written in\nanother language so that codes written in different languages can communicate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>NPM</h1>\n<p>NPM, node package manager is an official open source package manager for Node.js written purely in Javascript.</p>\n<h1>Pros</h1>\n<p>Following are some of the prominent highlights that make Node.js the first choice of software developers specially backend.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is asynchronous and event driven\nAll APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never\nwaits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events\nof Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.</li>\n<li>Super Fast\nBeing built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js is super efficient and quick in code execution.</li>\n<li>Single Threaded but Highly Scalable\nNode.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking\nway and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers like Apache which create limited threads to\nhandle requests.</li>\n<li>No Buffering\nNode.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>When to use Node.js?</h1>\n<p>Node.js as a platform fits and is typically used when the requirements include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I/O bound Applications</li>\n<li>Data Streaming Applications</li>\n<li>Data Intensive Real-time Applications (DIRT)</li>\n<li>JSON APIs based Applications</li>\n<li>Single Page Applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Worth noting is that Node.js also represent a \"JavaScript\" everywhere paradigm, and there is a lot of software\ndevelopers that are familiar with JavaScript.</p>\n<h1>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia - Node.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NPM</a></li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/articles/nodejs-architecture-overview/"}}}
