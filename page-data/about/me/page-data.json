I enjoy learning new technologies, tools and ways to solve problems,\nand I love being a consultant, helping clients solve their problems and desires. I see technology as a means to achieve\nsuccess for all stakeholders involved.</p>\n<p>During my years as a self-employed person, I have mainly held long assignments with private companies such as Preem\nPetroleum and ICA, where I have mainly managed, developed and assisted them with services around their intranet and\nwith processes and integrations to surrounding systems.</p>\n<p>For a few years now, I have worked less and taken the opportunity to train in modern technology in connection with health\nproblems. Today I am on my way back, and I hope I can get the chance to help you and your customers.</p>\n<p>The areas I invest in are partly, frontend development where I have extensive experience of JavaScript, jQuery, HTML,\nCSS, Web API and React.js with surrounding technologies, but also backend development in Node.js, preferably as cloud\nservices. I also have expert competence within the HCL Domino platform as I have worked with it since 1993.</p>\n<p>I look forward to hearing more about you, but also to telling you more about myself and how I can contribute and help.</p>\n<p>As a person I'm passioned about topics I love, want to have challenges in my life and always strives to improve my skills\nas a developer. I think I'm a social person, fast learner with an ability to adapt to changed situations and different\npeople.</p>\n<p>My main interest apart from helping customers, is sports. Today I love competing in golf and when I was much younger\nI was seriously good in Tennis. </p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about/me/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["4011214723"]}
